# Title: "Interactive Web Quiz App"

## Objective: Build a simple web quiz application that allows users to take a quiz and view their score.

### Steps:

1. Set up the project:

    - Create a new folder for your project.
    - Initialize a new HTML file (`index.html`), CSS file (`styles.css`), and JavaScript file (`script.js`).

2. Design the layout:

    - In the HTML file, create a container for the quiz, including a header, question section, answer options, and a submit button.
    - Use CSS to style the layout and make it visually appealing.

3. Create the quiz questions:

    - In the JavaScript file, define an array of objects representing the quiz questions. Each object should have properties like `question`, `options`, and `answer`.
    - Example:
        ```javascript
        const questions = [
            {
                question: 'What is the capital of France?',
                options: ['Paris', 'London', 'Berlin', 'Madrid'],
                answer: 'Paris'
            }
            // Add more questions here...
        ];
        ```

4. Implement the quiz logic:

    - In the JavaScript file, add event listeners to the submit button.
    - When the button is clicked, check the user's selected answer against the correct answer.
    - Keep track of the number of correct answers and display the score to the user.

5. Add additional features:

    - Display the current question number and total number of questions.
    - Allow the user to navigate between questions.
    - Provide feedback on whether the user's answer is correct or incorrect.
    - Add a timer to limit the time for each question.

6. Test and debug:

    - Test your quiz app by running the HTML file in a web browser.
    - Make sure all the features work as expected and fix any bugs you encounter.

7. Enhance the user experience:
    - Add animations or transitions to make the quiz app more engaging.
    - Allow the user to restart the quiz.
    - Store the user's score and display it on a leaderboard.
